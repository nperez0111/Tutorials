# Definitions that I think are true

### Syntax

This is basically the way that code is written, including order, possible options and style. An example of this is: It wouldn't make sense in English to write this sentence `The walks dog black around park` in the same way it doesn't make sense to write this in HTML 
```HTML
</ value="property" tag><tag>
```
