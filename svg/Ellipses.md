# Ellipses in SVG

Let's look at Ellipse Properties

## Syntax
```HTML
<ellipse cx="75" cy="75" rx="20" ry="5"/>
```

 - [`rx` property](#rx-property)
 - [`ry` property](#ry-property)
 - [`cx` property](#cx-property)
 - [`cy` property](#cy-property)

##Basic ellipse
Looks just how you thought it would.

## RX Property

This controls how wide the ellipse will be. More formally, this is the radius of the ellipse as it approaches 0 in height.

## RY Property

Same as above just switch X with Y.

## CX Property

Just like the circle this determines the starting point where the radius will spin about in terms of X.

## CY Property

Same as above just switch X with Y

Shapes are pretty boring right? [Let's just get into lines.](#Lines.md)
